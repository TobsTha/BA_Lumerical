These two simulation files contain the simulation setup employed to determine the optimal parameters for a 2D setup at an 5.65 degree diffraction angle.
They are the simulations presented in the thesis:
- the file 'Sim_5.65_degree_out-coupling' was used for the simulations employing the out-coupling configuration. Important are the sweeps 'Sweep_880', 'Sweep_890', 'Sweep_900', and 'Sweep_910' which were used for Figure 3.4.
- the file 'Sim_5.65_degree_in-coupling' was used for the simulations employing the in-coupling configuration. Important are the sweeps 'sweep_distanceWaist_vs_F', 'sweep_mesh_plot_BIG_plot', as these were used for Figure 3.6 and 3.7 in the thesis.

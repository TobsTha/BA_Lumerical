These two simulation files contain the simulation setup employed to determine the optimal parameters for a 2D setup at an 8 degree diffraction angle.
The optimization procedure was not as systematically as for the 5.65 degree setup. The maximal transmission of 40.3 % (at a maximal mesh step over the gratings of dx = dy = 0.03 microns) might be possible to improve.
The parameters used to simulate that value were: period: 868nm, distance from waist: d_w = 190 microns, x-position: d_x = 17.5 microns, initial filling factor: 0.95, final filling factor: 0.266

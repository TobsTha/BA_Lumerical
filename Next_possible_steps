Next possible steps include:

- the simulation of curved gratings with the gauss source at phi = 0.
- find optimized values for the FDTD solver size, C1, the distance between x=0 and the first grating, the grating angle phi_grating.
- include also the two tapers in the optimization process (for this it would also be possible to fit a guassian at the incoupled light intensity at x = 0
to inject the corresponding sourc directly in front of the tapers to optimizee them. 

- small adaptation of the phi = 45 degree angle. At phi = 45 degree, the gratings focos on z \approx 2.8 and not 0 as it should be for efficient coupling.

- after that, a new simulation employing two of these GCs at 45 degree over each other has to be designed.

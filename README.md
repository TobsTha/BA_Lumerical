Every folder has its own Readme describing the simulation file(s) in the folder. 
All simulations are for grating couplers with linear apodization on the SiN platform. For the efficiency values given, the number of gratings was always 50 (even if an increase of this number might lead to a better efficiency).
For further background the thesis origninating from this project can be considered (bachelor_thesis.pdf).

(The Python scripts used to plot the simulation data for the graphs of my thesis and the presentation slides can be found on the following repository: https://github.com/TobsTha/BA_code)
